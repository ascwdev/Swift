# Swift
Swift is a multi-purpose discord bot designed for niche servers.

## Foreword

Swift was initially designed as a university project to help me understand JavaScript better. It has since become larger-scope than anticipated, and as such, its been practical to treat this as a professional project. This would mean documenting each step of the process, the use of version control, as well as a manual for users who wish to incorporate Swift into their Discord Servers.

While there still is a long way to go until Swift is production ready, you can still observe progress on the project through this GitHub repository.

Additionally, below is a list of commands for operating Swift.
